            <p>Its been 7 months passed since the day that you've accepted my genuine love for you wovewove kooo, we go through a lot of struggling, harships, and many arguments last month my woveowve, but we choose to stay and fix things together mahal ko, alam mo ba wovewove akala ko dati wala tayong kakaharaping mga pagsubok nor darating sa paghihirap. i thought our love would be flawless, that somehow we wouldn't face any major obstacles. But then I realized, just like flowers need both the sun and the moon to flourish, so too does our love need both light and shadow to grow. any months from now wovewove we're approaching our very first anniversary na hihi, Sa pagpatak ng bawat sandali walang isang segundo na kung saan hindi kita nadudungaw sa aking isipan, walang humpay kong inaasam na mahagkan, at makita na kita maui. sinisigurado ko na palaging may nakahandang ngiti at sabay ng pagsambit sa ngalan mo pagdating ng bawat sandali. hehe wovewove, iwoveyouusomuchy, you can't measure how this word means when i am by your side na at pinaparamdam ko sayo mahal ko, we've been strong past month wovewove, i hope this month will be kinder to both of us na.  </p>
            <p>Iloveyousomuch my one and only, my baby, my wife and my sooner home, My Maureen Colinares  </p>
